# Human Detection in Images and Videos

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting humans in images or videos using advanced machine learning techniques. The system leverages a combination of computer vision and deep learning frameworks to achieve accurate and efficient human detection.

### Key Features
- Detect humans in static images.
- Detect humans in real-time video streams.
- Utilize pre-trained models like YOLO and Faster R-CNN for accurate detection.
- Provide bounding boxes around detected humans.
- Highly scalable and adaptable for various use cases (e.g., surveillance).

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- GPU with CUDA support (optional but recommended for better performance)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/human-detection.git
   cd human-detection
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the pre-trained model weights (e.g., YOLOv5, SSD):
   - Visit the [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) repository for pre-trained weights.
   - Save the downloaded weights in the `models/` directory.
